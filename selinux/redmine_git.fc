# We do not install contexts as part of the policy, since it is likely
# to be overridden by the local policy for parent directories.  The rakefile
# ( ../tasks/selinux.rake) will install file contexts "manually".
# 
# If you really want to install a file context, uncomment the following
# and rerun the install script or rake task
#
# /.*/redmine/vendor/plugins/redmine_git_hosting/bin(/.*)?  httpd_redmine_git_script_exec_t
